## Scottish Government Covid-19 Modelling

### Scottish Contact Survey

The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) developed a social
contacts survey called
[CoMix](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/comix-reports.html) which
is based on how many contacts people have each week. Participants
reported the total number of direct contacts that they had on the day
before the survey, which are people with whom they had at least a brief
face-to-face conversation, or with whom they had any sort of
skin-to-skin contact.

Scottish Government run the Scottish Contact Survey (SCS) which is based
on CoMix. This repository contains the [R package and code](scs-package.md) used to process
the raw survey data. LSHTM CoMix code is then applied to analyse the data
and produce outputs. The code for CoMix can be located
here: <https://github.com/amygimma/comix_shared_analyses>. 

SCS is a behavioural survey, asking questions to panels of people who
have been recruited to be broadly representative of the Scottish
population. It was launched in August 2020. Data is collected weekly,
using two different groups (Panels A and B) in alternating weeks. Adults
record their direct, face-to-face contacts made on the previous day,
specifying certain characteristics for each contact including the age
and sex of the contact, whether a meeting involved physical contact with
another person, and where contact occurred (e.g. home, at work, while
undertaking other activities, etc.).

The average number of contacts each person has is calculated for a range
of settings (home, work, school, and other). Exact ages of contacts is
not recorded, so a sample weighted by the population between the minimum
and maximum age reported for the contact is used.

Scottish Contact Survey contact matrices are published as [open data](http://statistics.gov.scot/data/scottish-contact-survey-contact-matrices). The dataset contains mean contacts between age groups for all waves of the survey since its inception in August 2020.

The Scottish Contact Survey closed in December 2022.


### Other Covid-19 Modelling

This model is one of a
[series](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ac19-modelling+org%3ADataScienceScotland+fork%3Atrue)
used by the Scottish Government during the pandemic to model the spread
and levels of Covid-19 in Scotland. Many of the results of these models
have been published in the [Modelling the
Epidemic](https://www.gov.scot/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-modelling-the-epidemic/)
series of reports.
